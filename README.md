# SQL_Quering-a-database
This project queries a music store database and presents visualizations based on the returns

In this project, I came up with 4 questions/issues that I answered with SQL. The questions are a bit complex and require at least one JOIN and one Aggregation. 
My presentation include slides, One visualization per slide and a 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide (query results from DB Browser were exported to a csv and Excel was used to create an appropriate chart)

Issues and questions posed in the queries are in the text file.
